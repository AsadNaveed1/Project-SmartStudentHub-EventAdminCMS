This session will feature real-world case studies and interactive discussions designed for a multidisciplinary audience, offering a deeper understanding of AIs evolving role in society.Day 2Metaverse Technologies and Cultural Heritage: Dimensionality, Control and Information Spaces by Prof. Eugene Chng - March 28, 6:30-8PMLecture Hall KB7307/F, Knowles Building, Main Campus, HKUThe metaverse, powered by XR technologies, opens new avenues for research and communication that go beyond traditional physical and digital boundaries. By bridging the physical and virtual worlds, these technologies create opportunities to overcome the limitations of physical spaces. In the Information Age, they enable transformative ways of engaging with cultural and heritage information. Contemporary society's constant exposure to diverse realities, particularly through social media, has shaped our perception and acceptance of visual content. The emergence of Generative AI further expands these possibilities, which is especially significant for cultural heritage sites and artifacts that are often unmodifiable or difficult to access. This talk explores these ideas through real-world projects, demonstrating how reality technologies are revolutionizing the study and communication of cultural heritage across millennia.

This lecture will showcase the studios distinctive modus operandi by presenting a series of interrelated projects: the renovation of an Art Nouveau villa on Lake Garda (Italy); C/O BARDI, a research and art residency programme; two books by its in-house publishing platform, EDIZIONI C/O BARDI; the teaching programme developed over the past two years at Syracuse University in Florence; and a chapter from Marina Montresors ongoing PhD thesis, Synecdoche, Los Angeles (developed at the ETH Zurich and the Getty Research Institute). Together, these diverse initiatives articulate an understanding of architecture as an inherently generalist discipline  collaborative at its core, adaptable to different challenges, and always engaged in thinking and acting through space. Functioning as both a prism and a mirror, the studio aims to reflect and transform its given context  whether physical, legal, political, or cultural  operating within an ever-changing landscape of possibilities.Biography:Marina Montresor is an architect by training, an artistic director by choice, and a writer by necessity. These three realms converge in her doctoral thesis, Synecdoche, Los Angeles (ETH Zurich, Getty Research Institute), as well as in the architectural and curatorial projects she undertakes with her studio. Alongside her practice, Marina teaches the diploma unit for the Charbonnet-Heiz Chair at ETH Zurich and lectures at Syracuse University in Florence. In 2022, she was a guest professor at TU Wien. She edited the book Defining Criteria (Quart Verlag) in 2018 and will publish the photobooks Calcio Storico by Zara Pfeifer and Postcards from Florence by Louis de Belle and Joris Kritis (EDIZIONI C/O BARDI) in 2025. In 2023, Marina founded the research project C/O BARDI, along with its publishing platform, EDIZIONI C/O BARDI.

This term refers to the dynamic shifts since the mid-20th century, which in the 21st century give rise to social and cultural dynamics oscillating between local and global, urban and rural, natural and artificial, and real and utopian, creating a moving-target context. Cho and Mass Studies respond to these evolving conditions with distinct territorial, typological, programmatic, and representational approaches.Biography:	Minsuk Cho founded the Seoul-based firm Mass Studies in 2003. The practice is dedicated to advancing architectural discourse through socio-cultural and urban research, focusing primarily on built works that have achieved global recognition. Notable projects include the Pixel House, Missing Matrix, Bundle Matrix, Shanghai Expo 2010: Korea Pavilion, Daum Space.1, Southcape Spa & Suite: Clubhouse, Daejeon University Residential College, Space K Seoul Museum, Pace Gallery Seoul, Won Buddhism Wonnam Temple, the extension and renovation of the French Embassy in Korea, the Osulloc Tea Museum and Tea Factory, and the Serpentine Pavilion 2024 Archipelagic Void.Current projects, all competition-selected, include the new Seoul Film Center, the Danginri Cultural Power Plant, and the Yeonhui Public Housing. Cho co-curated the 2011 Gwangju Design Biennale and served as commissioner and co-curator of the Korean Pavilion at the 2014 Venice Biennale and awarded the Gold Lion for Best National Participation. In late 2014, PLATEAU Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul, presented the first 12 years of Mass Studies' work, titled Before/After: Mass Studies Does Architecture.------------------------------Enquiry: arcevent@hku.hk All lectures are open to the general public.

Instead of a unidirectional governance transformation towards entrepreneurialism, rising finance and financialization, pervasive state roles in state capitalism, and post-growth municipal radicalism are competing trends. Previously, China witnessed private entrepreneurship, economic devolution, and housing commodification at the turn of the millennium. They have been portrayed as urban or state entrepreneurialism. These governance features have been transformed as China entered Xi Jinpings new era. This paper revisits the transformations in post-pandemic China and finds that rising state capital, re-centralization of spatial governance, and party-state co-governance represent the shift from entrepreneurial to managerial statecraft. The new trends broadly echo changing capital-state-society relationships in the world today. Beyond market rationality, the state mobilizes capital and society to pursue strategic intentionality. The transformation has been exacerbated by pandemic urgency, post-pandemic economic downturn, and greater geopolitical tension.About the Speaker:Professor Fulong Wu is Bartlett Professor of Planning at University College London. He received his PhD from the University of Hong Kong. His research interests include urban development in China and its social and sustainable challenges. He is the author of Planning for Growth: Urban and Regional Planning in China (Routledge, 2015), Creating Chinese Urbanism: Urban Revolution and Governance Change (UCL Press 2022) and a co-author of Governing Urban Development in China: Critical Urban Studies (Routledge 2024). ~~ ALL INTERESTED ARE WELCOME ~~Enquiries: 3917 2721CENTRE OF URBAN STUDIES AND URBAN PLANNINGTHE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG Date/Time02/04/202513:00-14:00VenueKB829LanguageEnglish",

    description: "The University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG), The University of Hong Kong, is honoured to work with photographer Chun Wai and the French May Arts Festival to present \"Adrift in TimePhotography by Chun Wai\", an exhibition of photographs taken by the artist in France in the 1980s1990s. Born in Hong Kong and educated at the cole suprieure des beaux-arts de Mulhouse in France, photographer Chun Wai toured Europe on a quest for the beginning of time, understanding that everything he photographed had a finite start and end.This physical and philosophical journey caused the artist to realise that his insights into the relationship suspended between predestination and chance were leading to an expansive form of lonelinessa state he felt was similar to the torment experienced by the ancient Chinese poets. Chun wandered the streets and alleys of great cultural centres like Paris discovering the collections of its great museums, art galleries and flea markets, along with the vast memories contained within, preserved and passed on through the course of time.For thirty years, Chun kept his images of France stored away in a box, as if preserving these treasured memories in a corner of time; a souvenir from which he can now extract memories. Since the 90s, some of the negatives have deteriorated to the point that the original images are no longer recognisable. They have become tangible illustrations of the passing of time, while the artists memories reactivate his endless associations. Whereas it has been said that photography freezes time, Chuns images and their varying states of damage attest to the flood of time. The reading of these images now leads to another journey, crossing the boundary between memory and forgetting, towards the subsequent truth of chaos.View the Digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/adrift-in-time1980199090https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/adrift-in-time Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "\"Alberto Reguera: Homage to Aert van der Neer\" ExhibitionThe University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) of the University of Hong Kong, is thrilled to present \"Alberto Reguera: Homage to Aert van der Neer\". Dazzled by the twilight of 17th-century painter Aert van der Neers (160377) \"Moonlit Landscape with a Road beside a Canal\" (164550), contemporary Spanish artist Alberto Reguera created a new series of paintings as an homage to the celebrated artist of the Dutch Golden Age. Each of Regueras paintings display an in-depth study of the representation of light and sky in the European tradition of painting, while engaging in a dialogue with Van der Neers \"Moonlit Landscape\".Aert van der Neers works exemplify the naturalistic renderings that are now recognised as one of the hallmarks of Dutch painting. Dating to the most productive period of the artists life (164060), aspects of this scene are typical for Van der Neer and his contemporaries, while the artists specific manipulation of twilight seeping through the clouds sets the work apart from other painters of his era.The sensitive depiction of light in the night sky most inspired Alberto Reguera, in part because of the similarities to his own work. These new works examine and connect directly to Van der Neers masterpiece, and the important painterly achievements of the Dutch painters generation. While the Golden Age landscapes have been widely discussed and imitated over the past three centuries, it is Regueras particularly intense form of study and thoughtful application of style that has culminated in these highly personal and accomplished works. Regueras own depictions of the skyboth day and nightinevitably differ from the Dutch master, as Reguera incorporates his own sensibilities and experiences from throughout his internationally renowned career.The exhibition and accompanying publication are the second collaboration between the UMAG and Alberto Reguera. While the first exhibition \"Blue Expansive Landscape\" (2015) was notable for the display of the painters two- and three-dimensional works, and his innovative ways of painting beyond the canvas, \"Homage to Aert van der Neer\" is a similarly complex endeavour that has been achieved through a successful partnership with UMAG, the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza and the artist. We thank the director and colleagues from the Museo Nacional and Alberto Reguera for this international cooperation, and express our gratitude to the University of Hong Kong Museum Society for its financial support.View the Digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/albertoreguera1645501603771640602015--https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/albertoreguera Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "The University Museum and Art Gallery of the University of Hong Kong is pleased to present an exhibition of early glass vessels that display technological and stylistic influences from countries along the Silk Road. Objects have been selected from a recent donation to UMAG along with additional loan items, which are either of Western Asian or Chinese origin. Though the technique of blowing glass was first developed by the Phoenicians in the Roman Empire in the first century BCE, the design outline of many shapes relates to Syro-Palestinian forms of the first century CE, and to Islamic Persian models found in both ceramic and metalware of the sixth century CE. All of these examples show an eastward dissemination of glass-making techniques and decorative styles.The international transfer of manufacturing practices, object types and design features make this particular collection of glassware a fascinating subject of study, as the knowledge transfer and trade along the Silk Road since the first millennium CE complicates the artefacts origins and cultural influences. Interestingly, this fine and fragile artform has been treasured for centuries and excavated objects from tomb sites often include both imported and Chinese items.View the Digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/blown-and-tooledhttps://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/blown-and-tooled Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "\"Cast and Chased: The Influence of Ancient Chinese Bronze on Modern Silver\" forms part of the University Museums UMAG_STArts series on science and technology in the arts, which presents the materials and techniques used to create artwork throughout Chinese cultural history. By juxtaposing early Chinese bronzes from the UMAG collection with silverware made by Wai Kee Jewellers Ltd. (est. 1885) for twentieth-century Hong Kong connoisseur Kwan Sai Tak, this exhibition considers the enduring characteristics of fine Chinese metalwork.Chinese bronzes of the Shang dynasty (c. 16001046 BCE) and the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 256 BCE) are among the most celebrated domestic and ritual objects in Asian material culture. The quality of the metal alloys and the technical expertise required for casting and chasing are testament to the highly developed manufacturing techniques. Made from tin-copper alloys with varying concentrations of lead, these objects were created in smelting sites located along the Yellow River in Central China. Many of the utilitarian vessels were decorated with cloud designs, taotie, animal masks and other auspicious symbols.Celebrated today for their enduring beauty, early Chinese bronzes also include practical objects, such as cooking and storage vessels, which offer insight into both the cultures from which they developed, as well as more contemporary objects. Their ornate splendour and utilitarian features have noticeably influenced the fanciful modern sterling silver pieces, while the craftsmanship emphasises the long-practiced technique of casting and chasing. This level of refined detail exemplifies the quality of Chinese metalworking throughout the millennia.View the Digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/cast-and-chasedUMAG_STArts18851600256https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/cast-and-chased Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "Clouds of Ink, Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren ExhibitionThe Chinese ink painter Hou Beiren has lived and worked in northern California for the last sixty years. \"Clouds of Ink, Pools of Colour: Paintings by Hou Beiren\" is the first exhibition of his splashed ink landscape paintings in Hong Kong.Splashed ink painting can be traced to the Tang (618907) and Southern Song (11271279) dynasties. After the fourteenth century, with changes in artistic taste, literati brushwork and painting dominated. But splashed ink remained popular in Japan, in ink wash painting of the Muromachi Period (13331578).In the 1950s, splashed ink experienced a revival at the hands of the great Chinese painter Zhang Daqian (18991983) who saw in it a response to the Abstract Expressionist paintwork then prevalent in Western modernist art. Zhang personally inspired Hou, who has since developed his splashed ink landscape painting into his own unique painting idiom.Hous landscapes rework the tropes of the traditional literati Chinese landscape, combining animated vortices of ink with swathes of colour into atmospheric meditations on both the practise of ink painting and the inheritance of traditional ink painting.The Hong Kong University Museum and Art Gallery wishes to gratefully acknowledge the support and cooperation of the Hou Beiren Art Gallery () in Kunshan, Jiangsu province in arranging and lending this exhibition.View the virtual exhibition here: https://tipeslowly.github.io/HBR/ ()  ()  ()  () https://tipeslowly.github.io/HBR/ Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "\"Colours of Congo\" complements the current UMAG exhibition of paintings created by Congolese artists spanning from the 1920s to 1960. The exhibition's narrative presents a generous overview of works instigated by a single artist from Belgium who began a painting workshop in collaboration with the indigenous population of Elisabethville (modern-day Lubumbashi). Over the decades, this first studio was followed by other workshops that assisted in developing a hybrid artform that remains a celebrated phenomenon today. The exhibition and accompanying volume of essays primarily examines this group of paintings as artworks worth considering on their own merits--describing their techniques and inherent beauty, while acknowledging that their iconographic contents reflect daily life within the various communities.View the exhibition here(English version only): https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/colours-of-congo-en19201960https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/colours-of-congo-en Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish",

    description: "The University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) and the Libraries of The University of Hong Kong will present \"Extraordinary Encounters: Malou Hungs Bookplates\" from May 18 to June 6, 2021. Curated by Sarah Ng, the exhibition employs a cross-cultural perspective for visualising Chinese material culture through the bookplates (ex libris) of celebrated Hong Kong artist Malou Oi Yee Hung.A bookplate is generally a small print placed on the inside front cover or free endpaper of a book to show ownership. In an era in which the popularity of print media continues to decline, the practice of including bookplates is fast becoming a dying art. Extraordinary Encounters refers to the surprising ways in which we still encounter bookplates during the act of reading. Alternatively, it stands for the remarkable encounters possible when viewing Hungs images, which go well beyond the general expectations of standard bookplates. These encounters have the ability to transport audiences across time and space, allowing for the appreciation of ancient artworks and diverse Hong Kong neighbourhoods as viewed from the artists extraordinary perspective.Bookplates have been appreciated for centuries as technically refined and beautiful artworks, as well as critical materials for learning about the history of art, printing, books and design. Many of the works on display here pay homage to everyday life in Hong Kongs bygone erasinformed by elements of traditional Chinese culturewhich forms an invaluable resource for the study of Chinese art and Hong Kong heritage.The exhibition also highlights historical objects from UMAGs collection, and items displayed online as part of a complementary virtual exhibition. The exhibitions five sections range from daily life in bygone eras to the material culture and craftsmanship of Imperial China: Rituals and Daily Life, Collected, Superfluous Things, Revisiting and Craftsmanship. The bookplates are juxtaposed with items from UMAGs permanent collection and printmaking tools.View the virtual exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/extraordinary-encounters-en202151866(ex libris)https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/extraordinary-encounters-tc Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueonlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

With this collection of images and documents selected largely from the HKU Archives, we hope to identify new materials and help generate fresh scholarship in the burgeoning global Eileen Chang studies.By piecing together a narrative that highlights the beginning of an extraordinary literary career, we celebrate Changs connection with the University of Hong Kong and the larger community. Drawing from previously unseen materials from the HKU Archives and other public and private collections, this exhibition seeks to redefine Changs solitary experiment as an important chapter in our collective knowledge of global Chinese and global English studies. The narrative that emerges from these images and documents in this online presentation marks only the beginning, as a physical exhibition at the historic Fung Ping Shan Building will be unveiled soon.

A native of Maoming county in Guangdong province, Ting Yin Yung (19021978) studied Western painting in Tokyo at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in the early 1920s. He returned to Mainland China in 1925 and emigrated to Hong Kong in 1949, where he further developed his artistic practice.Tings painterly styles vary widely. He excelled at figure paintings and abstract depictions that are indicative of Western influence. His figures bring to mind his study of form and volumea principal of Cubismwhereas other works are rendered in strong and contrasting coloursa characteristic of Fauvism. Master Ting consistently aimed to reconcile the techniques and characteristics of Western and Chinese approaches to painting.Tings artistic style is noteworthy for its simplicity and nuanced saturation of pigments.

    description: "\"Eternal Transience, Enlightened Wisdom: Masterpieces of Buddhist Art\" ExhibitionThe University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), is pleased to announce \"Eternal Transience, Enlightened Wisdom: Masterpieces of Buddhist Art\", an exhibition of more than 30 artworks from Tibet, Nepal, Pakistan and Mongolia. Dating from the 7th18th century, the exhibition is composed primarily of bronze statues and thangkas of deities and gurus in Tibetan Buddhism. This public display has been assembled to complement HKUs international symposium Giuseppe Tucci, his adventurous life, and his scholarly legacy, presented in memory of the renowned Tibetologist on 5 August 2022.As a form of religious art, the depicted hand gestures and weapons can be understood iconographically in the context of Tibetan Buddhism as symbols of wisdom and compassion that hold the power to enlighten all sentient beings. From an art historical perspective, these Himalayan masterpieces reflect an array of aesthetic and artistic traditions from neighbouring regions across the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia.As part of Buddhisms eternal journey from India to the Himalayas, China and Japan, the religious icons and objects of daily religious practice remain a testament to the shifting cultures that have engaged with Buddhism over the millennia. Acknowledging such a state of transience through the current exhibition highlights the enlightened wisdom of the Buddha; the ability to behold the true nature of the world.View the Digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/buddhistart718202285https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/buddhistart Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "Pre-dating the Neolithic period, ceramic wares are some of the earliest man-made objects to integrate science, technology and the arts. With a long history of innovation and craftsmanship, celadon wares have provided a crucial reference point for the study of ceramic production in China. The term celadon historically refers to specific types of ceramics coated with a green-coloured glaze. Taking its name from a French literary character best known for his distinctive green attire, some scholars prefer to avoid this arbitrary Western construction and instead apply the term greenware.Constant advances in raw material selection, firing techniques and the shaping of forms have enabled celadon ceramics to develop continuously over the past two millennia. The UMAG collection of celadon spans a period of more than fifteen hundred years of celadons history, from the early lead-glazed pottery of the Han (; 202 BCE220 CE) to the stunning Guan wares of the Song dynasty (; 9601279 CE), providing a rich overview of the traditions and transitions of these widely-coveted objects. This virtual exhibition complements the on-site exhibition of the same title, which will be unveiled soon at the Study Gallery in the historic Fung Ping Shan building.View the virtual exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/glazed-and-firedCeladonCeladonCeladonGreenware2022209601279 https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/glazed-and-fired Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "An upcoming exhibition at UMAG of HKU will showcase classic examples of statuary, stained glass, diptychs, textiles and caskets that were used in the expression of Christian devotion in Western Europe. \"High Gothic: Christian Art and Iconography of the 13th14th Century\", which opens on August 11 2021, will highlight selected objects from the McCarthy Collection. The exhibition aims to display the richness of Gothic artforms in both private and public spaces, while encouraging visitors to challenge the common perception that historical objects of art were monochromatic.Gothic was originally a derogatory term coined by Renaissance scholars to describe the barbaric medieval architecture that arose with the decline of the classical forms of the Roman Empire. The word is now understood to describe a style of buildings and objects created between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, which incorporated novel advances in stained glass production and architectural features such as the ogival arch.The Gothic period saw an increased emphasis on the power of images, where vision became an active force for activating emotion and inspiring contemplation. The exquisite Gothic objects featured in the McCarthy Collection represent a broad spectrum of workshops and styles across Western Europe, dating between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all of which contributed to the splendour we now associate with the aesthetic of the High Gothic.Dr Florian Knothe, Director of UMAG, HKU, said, Gothic art is extremely precious and rarely seen outside of Europe. We are thrilled to have this opportunity to work with the McCarthy Collection on this special exhibition that is entirely curated by UMAG for Hong Kong to introduce and highlight this colourful and narrative-rich pictorial art of Gothic Europe.Mr Robert McCarthy began assembling the McCarthy Collection over two decades ago, which now boasts an array of medieval artforms from Eastern and Western Europe.There are a number of exciting highlight objects in this exhibition, one being a series of three relief panels. Attributed to the Circle of the Master of Viboldone and spanning an impressive two meters, the fourteenth-century panels are carved from a single slab of marble and vividly depict episodes from the Life of Mary. Also featured are a dozen Gothic ivory diptychs, as well as a selection of stained glass panels. Many of the objects retain swathes of original pigments, which offer precious insight into the production and perception of art in the Gothic age.This special exhibition is organized by UMAG of HKU; and kindly supported by the McCarthy Collection, the University of Hong Kong Museum Society and the University of Hong Kong Endowment Funds for Music and Fine Arts.View the Digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/high-gothic2021811 (Mr Robert McCarthy) https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/high-gothic Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "The University Museum and Art Gallery, The University of Hong Kong is delighted to present Kings Inscriptions  Contemporary Interpretations, an unprecedented exhibition of calligraphic texts and their rubbings that juxtaposes historic and contemporary artworks. In Chinese history, inscriptions in stone, along with written copies and rubbings made to disseminate their meanings, frequently referred to the qualities and actions of kings. In our contemporary era, it is the work of self-proclaimed kings, such as the King of Kowloon and Frog King, among others, that captures our imagination.The exhibition is intended to be both academic and playful. It emphasises the lasting significance of the written word, showcases the historic occurrences of important calligraphic texts and highlights the innovative contemporary use of Chinese characters to convey traditional values, cultural phenomena and personal expressions. The selection of artworks highlights various media, including the display of rubbings on stone, calligraphic works on paper and the incorporation of script on ceramics. Additionally, the contemporary art installations serve as carriers of both text and meaning.This mixed-media display is a sign of our times. As less text is handwritten and digital presentations become more common, it is inspiring to appreciate the artistic qualities that transcend our increasingly rapid modes of communication. The exhibited artworks cause us to pause and reflect, bridging the past, offering a view of the present and suggesting practices that will likely gain more prominence in the future.View the Digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/king-s-inscriptionhttps://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/king-s-inscription Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "The University Museum and Art Gallery, The University of Hong Kong, is honored to present Noda Tetsuyas Diary of Contemporary Japanese Prints, an exhibition of autobiographic work by the celebrated Japanese artist. Noda first specialized in painting at the Tokyo University of the Arts before turning to printmaking. Influenced by his upbringing in post-war Japan, and the ideological, social, economic and artistic transformations of the era, Noda started to build a diary of prints in the 1960s recording his daily life, mastering the challenge of documenting the reality around him in both true and artistic fashion.Technically, Noda combines photography, traditional Japanese woodblock printing, mimeograph duplication and silkscreen printing in a self-invented and meticulously modulated process of production and layering. Thematically, he regularly features his family and friends, self-portraits, landscapes, gifts and a series of plants that double as a documentation of his life. These techniques and themes have remained largely unchanged throughout his career. The result is a life-long chronicle of intricately poetic prints where the private and everyday are given heightened significance and universal resonance.The exhibition investigates Nodas artistic concept, approach and reception in the midst of the ever shifting and vibrant arena of printmaking and the broader Japanese art world, spanning the latter half of the 20th century to the present. The displayed works, all taken from the Steven Co Collection, illustrate how Nodas innovations have carved the way for a reconsideration of the meanings of printmaking and art, beginning with his legendary victory at the Tokyo International Print Biennale in 1968. More importantly, they initiate a rethinking of the very identity of an artist. Often when trying to describe an artist, an image is conjured of an aloof figure, cocooned in his or her impenetrable mind and studio. We sometimes forget that artists are also flesh and blood, affected by families and relationships, who have similar hopes, joys, fears and anxieties fueled by our modern world.View the digital exhibition here: https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/nodatetsuya-diary19601968https://www.virtual.umag.hku.hk/nodatetsuya-diary Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "The University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) will present \"Objectifying China: Ming and Qing Dynasty Ceramics and Their Stylistic Influences Abroad\" from December 9, 2017 to February 27, 2018. Presented with the support of Robert Black College and objects from the collections of UMAG, the Asian Civilisations Museum, Singapore and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum, Objectifying China examines how the international trade in ceramics spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies throughout various regions. These exchanges dramatically altered the course of Asian and European art, producing objects prized for their exotic origins, superior technology and beauty.A Global IndustryFor thousands of years, China has provided the world with porcelain of the highest quality. Elegant and resistant to heat and moisture, Chinese porcelain of various shapes and colours was eagerly soughtand just as eagerly imitatedby craftsmen across the globe. From the sixth to twentieth centuries, Chinese kilns produced everything from magnificent display pieces for the imperial court to vast quantities of bowls and dishes intended for everyday use, as well as for export to Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world.The first Chinese porcelains did not arrive in Europe until the fourteenth century, when small numbers were presented to the ruling houses of Europe via intermediaries in the Middle East. Technologically superior to low-fired European ceramics, they were regarded as objects of rarity and luxury, and were sometimes mounted with silver or gold to emphasise their preciousness. By the early sixteenth centuryafter Portugal had established trade routes to ChinaChinese potters began to produce large amounts of porcelain specifically for export to Europe as part of a larger trade in silk, spices, tea and lacquer.Like all successful inventions, porcelain inspired competition. Kilns in Asia had been producing a wide variety of ceramics in imitation of Chinese wares for centuries, but European attempts to imitate porcelain were unsuccessful until Johann Bttger unlocked the process in Meissen, Germany in 1709. By the end of the century, factories across Europe were producing hybrid works that combined the best features of European and Asian design.View the Digital Exhibition here: https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/201712920182276201416170918https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/ Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueonlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "While archaeologists and historians have yet determined the origin of painting, ancient men and women used color in decoration and ornamentation by scratching the outlines of people and animals upon slate and bone. Traces of this kind of primitive work still remain to us on the pottery and stone implements of the cave dwellers.Today, painting is generally understood as the creation of certain aesthetic qualities in a two-dimensional visual language. Elements of this visual languagecolors, lines, textures, and shapesare applied in various ways to create visual forms of light, space, movement, and contrast on a flat surface. These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order to represent real or imaginary phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create wholly abstract images.Painting is the theme of the inaugural section of UMAG_STArts, and the recently acquired work by the Hong Kong artist Ng Lung Wai will be displayed as the highlight of the thematically-focused exhibition at our newly refurbished study gallery. The medium and technique of Wais painting, as well as the way the work was created, daringly challenge the traditional boundaries of the painted art, interrogating and altering our perceptions of paining as a convention of art. This digital learning platform not only contains an essay about the development of painting in China through the UMAG collection and a biographical account of Ng Lung Wai, but also includes a pre-recorded interview with the artist Ng Lung Wai and the process of his creative practice.View the Digital Exhibition here: https://www.starts.umag.hku.hk/painting : Learn with UMAGhttps://www.starts.umag.hku.hk/painting Date/Time01/07/2024to30/06/202500:00-23:59VenueOnlineLanguageEnglish and Chinese",

    description: "Bats represent good luck, while pine trees symbolise longevity due to their resilience. Many of us can quickly identify the 8 Immortals, yet remembering their individual names and attributes is more challenging. When faced with artworks from ancient times, we often find ourselves astonished by the intricate ornaments, marvellous signs and rich symbolic language. We can sense the deep meaning behind them, yet the stories they tell and the secrets they hold are no longer widely known or taught.  In both mythology and this exhibition, the number 8 plays a crucial role. The symmetrical shape of the number 8 symbolises an endless cycle, a constant flow of energy, balance, harmony and infinity. While in Cantonese-speaking communities the number 8 stands for wealth, in Christian numerical symbolism it signifies new beginnings and resurrection. And since 8 is a Fibonacci number, it can be found in nature all over the world. In Asian art this can be seen, for example, in the 8 trigrams of the I Ching, the 8 Immortals, the 8 Buddhist symbols or Auspicious objects. These interrelated elements are often depicted as a group of 8 in the form of a serial narrative, which are supplemented by motifs of pairs, figures or scenes from stories, landscapes, plants, flowers, animals, ornaments and symbols.  To illustrate this point, several objectseach consisting of eight sectionswere selected from the UMAG collection. These items demonstrate the diversity and richness of serial narratives in Chinese art and craftsmanship. In addition to the narrative structure, these eight-part objects can be understood as components of superordinate systems. In the microcosm of their diverse details, they refer to the macrocosm of mythology, which results in a network of relationships that continuously refer back to one another. This dynamic interplay between individual elements within a larger whole is also evident in the contemporary artworks of YAU Wing Fung (*1990) and Daphne Alexis HO (*1975) from Hong Kong, YU Hee (*1967) from Korea, Adrian FALKNER (*1979) from Switzerland and Klaus MERKEL (*1953) and Arvid BOECKER (*1964) from Germany. However, in their work this interaction unfolds through form and colour, alienation and manipulation, as well as self-referential quotations and artistic dialogue. The six contemporary artists are juxtaposed with the traditional works of applied art so as to demonstrate that serial and systemic narratives are still used today as artistic strategies. Systemic is used here in the sense that individual works of art can be seen as part of a larger overall system of interrelated elements. The interplay between the individual symbols and the overarching programme mirrors the relationship between contemporary art and traditional arts and crafts. Together, they complement each other in an inspiring way, inviting our visitors to uncover hidden meanings and deeper connections.  8888  19901975(1967Adrian FALKNER1979Klaus MERKEL1953Arvid BOECKER1964  Date/Time21/03/2025to08/06/202509:30-18:00Venue1/F, T.

The representations of ethnic minorities, created by both Han and non-Han filmmakers, are grasped as part of an ecosystem in which the cultures, values, and life practices of non-Han ethnic minorities are closely entwined with environmental issues and politics. These representations became a site in which state authorities, Han and non-Han communities, and foreign agencies compete and interact under the context of building and imagining the Chinese nation-state.Kwai-Cheung Lo is Professor and Department Chair of Humanities and Creative Writing at Hong Kong Baptist University.

    description: "The exhibition Wondrous Rivers: Exploring Chinese Landscape Paintings invites visitors to immerse themselves in the captivating world of Chinese landscape paintings from the collection of the University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG), The University of Hong Kong. As a sequel to the 2024 exhibition Momentous Mountains: The Artistic, Philosophical and Cultural Engagement with Chinese Landscape Painting, this showcase presents a diverse series of paintings spanning from the early Qing dynasty (17th century) to contemporary times. The artists, hailing from different time periods and various regional cultures and training backgrounds, collectively exemplify the multi-faceted evolution of this painting genre.   The exhibition features a selection of artworks by renowned Chinese landscape painters, including the literati painter Zha Shibiao, active in the Jiangnan area, and Guangdong painters Li Jian, Su Renshan and Liang Yuwei, each known for their distinct personal style. Within the context of the development of modern Chinese painting, the Lingnan School advocated for a fusion of Chinese and Western styles, while the Guangdong Chinese Painting Research Society sought innovation within the paradigm of tradition. The vibrant artistic interactions between the Guangdong, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai art scenes can be seen in the works of artists like Huang Binhong, Zhang Hong, Lu Zishu and Chiu Sai-Kwong (Zhao Shiguang), reflecting the depth and virtuosity of the evolution of 20th-century Chinese painting and the enduring friendships transcending time and space in the Hong Kong art community. Rarely displayed in public, the exhibition includes iconic works by renowned modern masters and influential art educators such as Liu Haisu, Fang Zhaoling, Rao Zongyi, Harold Wong Chung-fong and Wan Qingli, along with Hong Kong and Hong Kong Malaysian masters Choi Hoi-ying (Cai Haiying) and Liew Come-tong (Liu Qindong), revealing their unwavering commitment to ink art.   The collection of Chinese landscape paintings constitutes the foundation of UMAGs educational and research efforts. Since establishing the collection and making it publicly accessible in the 1950s, UMAG has been closely connected to the development of twentieth-century Chinese painters, actively documenting and studying the evolution of local artistic talents and the Hong Kong art scene. We would like to thank our community of donorsboth artists and collectorsfor their generosity and for being part of this fascinating journey.

    description: "Bats represent good luck, while pine trees symbolise longevity due to their resilience. Many of us can quickly identify the 8 Immortals, yet remembering their individual names and attributes is more challenging. When faced with artworks from ancient times, we often find ourselves astonished by the intricate ornaments, marvellous signs and rich symbolic language. We can sense the deep meaning behind them, yet the stories they tell and the secrets they hold are no longer widely known or taught.  In both mythology and this exhibition, the number 8 plays a crucial role. The symmetrical shape of the number 8 symbolises an endless cycle, a constant flow of energy, balance, harmony and infinity. While in Cantonese-speaking communities the number 8 stands for wealth, in Christian numerical symbolism it signifies new beginnings and resurrection. And since 8 is a Fibonacci number, it can be found in nature all over the world. In Asian art this can be seen, for example, in the 8 trigrams of the I Ching, the 8 Immortals, the 8 Buddhist symbols or Auspicious objects. These interrelated elements are often depicted as a group of 8 in the form of a serial narrative, which are supplemented by motifs of pairs, figures or scenes from stories, landscapes, plants, flowers, animals, ornaments and symbols.  To illustrate this point, several objectseach consisting of eight sectionswere selected from the UMAG collection. These items demonstrate the diversity and richness of serial narratives in Chinese art and craftsmanship. In addition to the narrative structure, these eight-part objects can be understood as components of superordinate systems. In the microcosm of their diverse details, they refer to the macrocosm of mythology, which results in a network of relationships that continuously refer back to one another. This dynamic interplay between individual elements within a larger whole is also evident in the contemporary artworks of YAU Wing Fung (*1990) and Daphne Alexis HO (*1975) from Hong Kong, YU Hee (*1967) from Korea, Adrian FALKNER (*1979) from Switzerland and Klaus MERKEL (*1953) and Arvid BOECKER (*1964) from Germany. However, in their work this interaction unfolds through form and colour, alienation and manipulation, as well as self-referential quotations and artistic dialogue. The six contemporary artists are juxtaposed with the traditional works of applied art so as to demonstrate that serial and systemic narratives are still used today as artistic strategies.

    description: "The Archeology Webinar SeriesDeconstructing Clan Cemeteries: Theoretical and Methodological Reflections on Late Shang Mortuary ArchaeologyYuwei Zhou PhD CandidateDepartment of East Asian Languages and CivilizationsUniversity of ChicagoAbstractInitially excavated in 1928 as Chinas first archaeological investigation, the Bronze Age settlement of Anyang in Henan province remains one of the most significant discoveries in Chinese archaeology. In 1979, a report on the Western Locus cemetery established an influential paradigm for late Shang mortuary studies: tomb grouping (muzang fenqu ), a method that divides cemeteries into spatial clusters to infer clan structures. This approach was quickly adopted in analyses of cemeteries within and beyond Anyang, reinforcing a widespread interpretation of clan-based social organization. Today, despite some skepticism, this view remains deeply embedded in narratives of Shang archaeology.This study critically re-examines the term clan cemetery by tracing its scholarly origins and reassessing its methodological basis through computational analysis. As recent excavations reveal increasing variability in archaeological data that challenges the clan-based model, this study draws on anthropological theories to propose a new understanding of Anyang mortuary dynamics within an urban context. About the SeriesThe Archaeology Webinar Series aims to provide a platform for scholars, students, and enthusiasts to discuss and share knowledge about archaeology, its importance, recent discoveries, research methods, and its significance in understanding the past. The series aims to promote awareness, education, and appreciation for archaeology among academia and the general public and foster a sense of curiosity and interest in exploring our shared human history.

    description: "This book probes why ecological instability has time and again emerged as a catalyst for risky development projects along India's south-west coastline. It will do so by examining the genealogy of a political and ecological crisis confronting the colonial state around the port of Cochin in the first quarter of the 20th century, and the legacy of the measures taken in response. While the ecological crisis was triggered by fears surrounding an \"encroaching\" sea, the political crisis was precipitated by a neighbouring princely state's unprecedented attempt to extend its sovereignty over the British port. By examining just why the colonial state chose to respond to this twin crisis with a risky development scheme, this book contributes to scholarship on environmental transformations and development in modern South Asia  and on the uneven nature of colonial sovereignty.Dr. Devika Shankar is a historian of South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. Her research interests primarily lie in environmental history, legal history and science and technology studies.

Arguing for intersectionality as a reading method rather than strictly a tool of social analysis, I explore the productive potential of incoherence in literature by Koreans in Japan, particularly at a moment when anxieties about the end of Zainichi literature are on the rise. Engaging with the incoherence of both the genre and the text, I argue, allows for a more ethical approach to the literary production of communities that resist representation within existing paradigms, such as Koreans in Japan.Cindi Textor is Associate Professor in the Department of World Languages and Cultures at University of Utah. Her work on incoherence, illegibility, and intersectionality in Korean- and Japanese-language fiction has appeared in positions: asia critique, Journal of Korean Studies, and other venues.

Registration is required.This talk expands on the popular notion of screen time to think about the time one spends on consuming screen-based media (e.g. cinema, television, digital media) as a crucial interface linking modern everyday life to political economies. How much time should screens take up in peoples lives? How to determine when screen consumption is productive, and when it becomes a waste of time? Through two seemingly unrelated case studies, itinerant film exhibition during the Great Leap Forward Movement (1958-1962) and contemporary online live streaming, I show how the management of screen time negotiates dominant paradigms of productivity across different historical periods.

    description: "Chinese Business History WebinarVolkswagen and Chinas Early Reform Era, 1978-1991Professor Chen TaoTongji UniversityAbstractVWs destiny will be shaped by the Chinese market, predicted Herbert Diess, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen Group, in early 2019 amidst escalating geopolitical tensions between China and the West. As the largest automobile company in Europe, VW has implemented a series of measures and initiatives to solidify its position in the Chinese market in recent years, despite frequent warnings from the German federal government to reduce German companies dependence on China. The willingness of leading German enterprises, including VW, to engage in decoupling and risk mitigation from China underscores the deep economic ties between Germanys crucial industry and China. Understanding VWs intense focus on China requires delving into the history of its interactions with its largest global market. However, much remains unknown about the perspectives of decision-makers in Wolfsburg and Beijing regarding VWs entry into China. Additionally, insights into the establishment and evolution of VWs Joint Venture in Shanghai, often referred to as the flagship project of Chinese-German economic cooperation, are limited. This talk adopts a comprehensive approach to scrutinize various actors and events that contributed to VWs entanglement with China, elucidating the historical intricacies of this relationship.About the SpeakerTao Chen is Associate Professor of German Studies at Tongji University, Shanghai.

    description: "Bats represent good luck, while pine trees symbolise longevity due to their resilience. Many of us can quickly identify the 8 Immortals, yet remembering their individual names and attributes is more challenging. When faced with artworks from ancient times, we often find ourselves astonished by the intricate ornaments, marvellous signs and rich symbolic language. We can sense the deep meaning behind them, yet the stories they tell and the secrets they hold are no longer widely known or taught.  In both mythology and this exhibition, the number 8 plays a crucial role. The symmetrical shape of the number 8 symbolises an endless cycle, a constant flow of energy, balance, harmony and infinity. While in Cantonese-speaking communities the number 8 stands for wealth, in Christian numerical symbolism it signifies new beginnings and resurrection. And since 8 is a Fibonacci number, it can be found in nature all over the world. In Asian art this can be seen, for example, in the 8 trigrams of the I Ching, the 8 Immortals, the 8 Buddhist symbols or Auspicious objects. These interrelated elements are often depicted as a group of 8 in the form of a serial narrative, which are supplemented by motifs of pairs, figures or scenes from stories, landscapes, plants, flowers, animals, ornaments and symbols.  To illustrate this point, several objectseach consisting of eight sectionswere selected from the UMAG collection. These items demonstrate the diversity and richness of serial narratives in Chinese art and craftsmanship. In addition to the narrative structure, these eight-part objects can be understood as components of superordinate systems. In the microcosm of their diverse details, they refer to the macrocosm of mythology, which results in a network of relationships that continuously refer back to one another. This dynamic interplay between individual elements within a larger whole is also evident in the contemporary artworks of YAU Wing Fung (*1990) and Daphne Alexis HO (*1975) from Hong Kong, YU Hee (*1967) from Korea, Adrian FALKNER (*1979) from Switzerland and Klaus MERKEL (*1953) and Arvid BOECKER (*1964) from Germany. However, in their work this interaction unfolds through form and colour, alienation and manipulation, as well as self-referential quotations and artistic dialogue. The six contemporary artists are juxtaposed with the traditional works of applied art so as to demonstrate that serial and systemic narratives are still used today as artistic strategies. Systemic is used here in the sense that individual works of art can be seen as part of a larger overall system of interrelated elements. The interplay between the individual symbols and the overarching programme mirrors the relationship between contemporary art and traditional arts and crafts. Together, they complement each other in an inspiring way, inviting our visitors to uncover hidden meanings and deeper connections.  8888  19901975(1967Adrian FALKNER1979Klaus MERKEL1953Arvid BOECKER1964  Date/Time26/04/202513:00-13:30Venue1/F, T.

    description: "Faculty of LawThe University of Hong KongThe Value of Claim-Rights28 March 2025 (Friday), 12:00-1:00 PMRoom 824, 8/F Cheng Yu Tung Tower, The University of Hong KongIt is often considered to be of importance to determine whether a legal duty correlates with a claim-right. At the same time, philosophers of (private) law have tended to accept that possession of a claim-right does not necessarily entail (i) standing to hold a person accountable for breach of the duty, (ii) the enforceability of the duty, (iii) the ability of the claim-right to guide the duty-bearers conduct or deliberations, (iv) the power to waive the duty. This generates a puzzle: if having a claim-right doesnt necessarily have any of these normative upshots, why does it matter whether a person has a claim-right? In this talk, I consider possible answers to this puzzle.About the SpeakerSandy Steel is currently Visiting Research Professor at HKU.

    description: "ABOUT THE LECTUREThere is a tendency, particularly outside England, to be critical of the common law rules for the recognition of foreign judgments. Viewers from the commercial centres of East Asia, and elsewhere, may look at the rules they have received and imagine that they see something made a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away (and in which imperial suspicion of foreign adjudication motivated the law). They may have a point, but it is perhaps not the point that they believe they have. Common law conflicts rules, which were devised for a nineteenth-century world of common law, are not always an easy fit in a legal system now groaning under the weight of legislated law. The lecture will aim to explain where, and why, some second thoughts about foreign judgments are coming to the surface.About the speakerAdrian Briggs retired from the University of Oxford as Professor of Private International Law, and from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, as Tutorial Fellow, in 2021, after 41 years of service.

    description: "Can large language models (LLMs) serve as \"AI judges\" that provide consistent answers to legal questions? I conduct the first series of empirical experiments to test several fundamental questions about LLM reliability for legal interpretation. My findings reveal significant concerns. First, LLM judgments exhibit extreme sensitivity to minor variations in prompt phrasing, giving opposite responses to semantically equivalent questions. Second, LLM judgments are highly sensitive to the model chosen, with virtually no correlation (r = 0.051) between the judgments of different LLMs on identical interpretive questions, suggesting the choice of model could dramatically influence legal outcomes. Third, post-training procedures used to create the most popular models, like ChatGPT and Claude, can cause LLM assessments to substantially deviate from mere predictions of language use in their corpora, which casts doubts on claims that LLMs can elucidate ordinary meaning.These results challenge the assertion that LLMs provide objective interpretive guidance and suggest they may be vulnerable to strategic manipulation. While LLMs may still have value as interpretive tools, their current limitations demand significant caution from judges and scholars.Jonathan H. Choi is a professor of law at USC Gould School of Law.

Yet, under forum non conveniens own logic, jurisdiction agreements should generally be given significant weight, because they generally reflect parties well-informed views about the most appropriate forum for their dispute. This account explains various features of the strong cause test, like the relevance of foreseeability, third party interests, and parties respective bargaining powers. It also holds implications for the tests applicability to breaches of non-exclusive jurisdiction agreements and in applications for contractual anti-suit injunctions.About the Speaker:Marcus Teo is an Assistant Professor at NUS Law, specialising in private international law, public law and foreign relations law.

But 10 years on from the UK Supreme Courts decision in Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales Police [2015] UKSC 2, that did so much to bring some order to the law on liability for omissions in tort, three ideas threaten to throw this area of law into new, uncharted and stormy waters. These ideas are that a defendant may be held liable to a claimant for failing to take reasonable steps to save them from being injured if (a) the defendant assumed a responsibility to the claimant, or (b) the defendant foreseeably interfered with a third partys or the claimants saving the claimant from being injured, or (c) that common humanity demanded that the defendant take reasonable steps to save the claimant from being injured. This lecture will discuss each of these dangerous ideas and how their future development might impact on the law on liability for omissions in tort.About the SpeakerNick McBride is a Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge and is the author of: The Humanity of Private Law, Parts I and II (Hart Publishing, 2019 and 2020); Letters to a Law Student, 5th ed (Pearson Education, 2022); Tort Law, 7th ed (Pearson Education, 2024) (with Roderick Bagshaw); Great Debates in Jurisprudence, 2nd ed (Macmillan Publishing, 2018) (with Sandy Steel); and Key Ideas in Contract Law (Hart Publishing, 2018) and Key Ideas in Trusts Law (Hart Publishing, 2023).

The seminar will consider commitments countries have made under the Paris Agreement to submit emissions reduction pledges known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and how taxation ts into different countries NDCs (or not). Thereafter, the seminar will briey examine (1) carbon taxes, (2) emissions trading systems (a variant of carbon taxes), (3) carbon border adjustments (which are tariffs and thus a variant of taxes), and (4) tax incentives that encourage and tax measures that discourage climate mitigation.The seminar will then turn to the principles of taxation examining statements of the IMF, the OECD and other commentators on tax principles. What are such principles? Are income taxes different from regulatory taxes for this purpose? The seminar will conclude by examining what is a \"good tax\" and a \"bad tax\" in the climate change mitigation area.About the SpeakerArchie Parnell teaches two courses at the Law School of Jindal Global University in India: (1) A Tale of Two Tax Systems: Discerning Solutions for India-US Tax Disputes and (2) How Taxation Can Help Address Climate Change.

    description: "As the anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing notes: [c]ontinued life on earth depends on getting our knowledge into as good a shape as possible. Given the physical and social complexity of environmental problems, that is not easy. It is also a matter that raises classic public law issues  albeit in ways that make them both novel and quintessential public law questions. In this lecture, by drawing on examples from across common law jurisdictions, I show how addressing those public law questions requires lawyers to foster their legal expertise so as to imagine better when it comes to both environmental problems and public law.

    description: "Date & Time: April 16, 2025 (Wednesday) 12:30-13:30Venue: Room 723, 7/F, Cheng Yu Tung Tower, The University of Hong KongLanguage: English(In-person event) Abstract:Many tort law theorists seek to understand the nature of tort law  that is, to make tort law intelligible. They often do so by adopting the so-called interpretive approach, which tries to both describe and normatively or morally justify tort law doctrines and practices.In this talk, I argue that interpretivists face a two-horned dilemma. The first horn is what I call the problem of proportionality: We do not know how much a theory should describe and how much it should justify in order to be counted as a successful theory. To resolve this, I propose that interpretivists could appeal to two considerations in the contemporary philosophy of psychology: (1) a conception of rationality as morality  that is, being rational is being morally or normatively justified, and (2) the idea that rationality is necessary for intelligibility in psychological interpretation. By integrating these considerations, interpretivists could argue that portraying tort law as normatively or morally justified makes it rational  and thus intelligible, the ultimate goal of tort law theory. This allows interpretivists to favor the distribution between description and justification that maximizes justification: interpretivists should justify as much as possible to make tort law rational and intelligible, while describing just enough to ensure they are still interpreting tort law.Yet this solution leads to the second horn of the dilemma. By relying on rationality as morality to resolve proportionality, interpretivists are very likely to fail to understand what tort law actually is. I argue that tort law is an output of behaviors and thoughts of many different minimally rational agents, whose moral views are varied and whose reasoning capacities are largely non-ideal. Thus, tort law is very unlikely to be morally justified. Hence, interpretivists face the dilemma of either confronting the problem of proportionality or failing to understand tort law.Speaker: Yubo Wang holds a PhD in Law from University College London (specializing in jurisprudence) and is a Hongyi Postdoctoral Fellow at Wuhan University School of Law. He earned his LLM in Jurisprudence and Legal Theory from UCL, along with a Master and a Bachelor of Law from China University of Political Science and Law. His research focuses on general jurisprudence and philosophy of tort law, drawing on resources in contemporary philosophy  such as metaethics and the philosophy of psychology  to examine questions within and surrounding legal theory.

    description: "ABSTRACTNo debate! is an imperative issued by some individuals with strong views about culturally salient moral or political issues. Inside academia, it shows up in refusals to cite or engage with work; refusals to share platforms; refusals to invite particular people to conferences or workshops. 'No debate!' is a common political tactic, often deployed by the side that enjoys the support of the public (why risk losing it?), and/or as a way of signalling the intensity of one's moral judgement (just think how bad your view must be if I am willing to silence you over it!). In this talk I'm interested in the question of whether 'no debate!' is ever more than a political move. If it is sometimes unethical to debate: when, and why? And do the same normative considerations that apply in thinking about debate in the public sphere apply equally inside the university?SPEAKERHolly Lawford-SmithAssociate Professor in Political Philosophy, University of MelbourneABOUT THE SPEAKERSHolly Lawford-Smith is Associate Professor in Political Philosophy at the University of Melbourne.

    description: "ABSTRACTThe post-Cold War decline of conflict has turned into an increase both within and between states. Many observers interpret this development as the return of geopolitics and great power competition. Shifting the focus to nationalist geopolitics, we link this violent resurgence to the exclusion of ethnic groups and their transborder kin. Using newly collected data on ethnic power relations, we explore trends in ethnic exclusion and conflict, analyze difference-in-difference models to establish a connection between these trends, and build counterfactual scenarios to assess the violent impact of ethnic nationalism since the early 2010s. Overall, our analysis confirms that liberal backsliding has contributed to increased conflict around the world, a trend shift that cannot be reduced to intensified great power competition.SPEAKERLars-Erik CedemanProfessor of International Conflict ResearchETH ZrichABOUT THE SPEAKERSLars-Erik Cederman is professor of international conflict research at ETH Zrich.

However, corporate purpose is also relevant to areas of law beyond corporate law because it addresses corporate power and how it should be constrained. Competition law, which regulates market power, is also concerned with corporate power. In this lecture, Associate Professor Wendy Ng will explore the relevance of corporate purpose to competition law. In particular, she will examine how corporate purpose and the shared focus on corporate power are meaningful avenues through which interactions between competition law and corporate law can be understood and explored.About the SpeakerWendy Ng is an Associate Professor at Melbourne Law School. She researches on competition law, focusing on political economy, comparative, and interdisciplinary issues. She has received a number of awards for her research, including the University of Melbourne Chancellors Prize for Excellence in the PhD thesis, the ABA Section of Antitrust Law International Scholar-in-Residence Award, and Concurrence Antitrust Writing Awards. In 2022, Wendy was named by Global Competition Review as one of the 25 most influential antitrust academics in the world. She has been a Non-Governmental Advisor to the International Competition Network and worked with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to support the introduction and development of competition law and policy in Southeast Asia.

The types of intervention also vary. Under what conditions will Beijing intervene and what explains the variation? Focusing on four case studies in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, we demonstrate that Beijing intervenes when its interests are significantly impacted, but the way it intervenes depends on the cooperation of actors, both state and non-state, within host countries. Our study contributes to the understanding of Chinese security interventions and influence abroad, and the conditions that modify its interventions.SPEAKERSelina HoAssociate Professor in International Affairs, Co-Director of the Centre on Asia and GlobalisationLee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy,National University of SingaporeABOUT THE SPEAKERSSelina Ho is Associate Professor in International Affairs and Co-Director of the Centre on Asia and Globalisation, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.

    description: "Asian Institute of International Financial LawFaculty of Law, The University of Hong KongThe 19th Asian Institute of International Financial Law Distinguished Public LectureThe Singular Role of Public Pension Funds in Corporate Governance2 May 2025 (Friday), 6:00-7:00 PMAcademic Conference Room, 11/F Cheng Yu Tung Tower, The University of Hong KongLike private asset managers, managers of public pension funds are typically expected to serve the interests of the funds beneficiaries exclusively through their investing and engagement decisions, a model that we term beneficiary primacy. Beneficiary primacy theorizes that the best way for fund managers to serve these interests is to maximize the economic value of the fund, and the law implements beneficiary primacy through the fiduciary duties it imposes on fund managers. In my forthcoming article to be published in the Texas Law Review, co-authored with Professor Jeff Schwartz at the University of Utah, we take a different approach. We argue that, for public pension funds, beneficiary primacy is wrong, and that it unduly constrains public pension fund managers by attaching legal risk to their transformative role in corporate governance. We identify the key features that warrant treating public pension funds as principals, rather than agents. These same features uniquely position public pension funds to bring a broader vision of public interest and accountability to corporate governance and the financial markets.About the SpeakerProfessor Jill E. Fisch is the Saul A. Fox Distinguished Professor of Business Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School where she teaches and writes on corporate law, corporate governance, civil procedure and securities regulation.

We used WES, scRNAseq, and Bulk RNAseq to systematically study the mechanism of tumor regulation and microenvironment regulation in the NE region. In this study, we found that the tumor microenvironment in the NE region showed very strong neural specialization, accompanied by dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. This may be due to the effect of SLITRK2 on PTPRD receptors of glial cells such as neurons, resulting in changes in the communication mode of each cell so that the tumor cells can adapt to the environment. Abnormal activation of the NRG-ERBB pathway and SLIT2-ROBO pathway in the NE region is observed in neurons, which makes the microenvironment more suitable for tumor survival and metastasis and results in neurologic imbalance. The FGF signal between tumors is also significantly enhanced, which will promote drug resistance and the malignant development of tumor cells. Tumor cells also secreted a large amount of PTN to act on OPC, which significantly promoted the transformation of OPC into oligodendroglia. As a result, in bulk RNAseq deconvolution of patients, OPC in the NE region was significantly lower than that in the CE region, and the proportion of oligodendroglia in the NE region was significantly increased, which destroyed the balance of the original neural microenvironment. These changes in the neural microenvironment of tumors in the NE region also explain the causes of complications such as brain function injury in patients to a certain extent. In the evolution of myeloid cells, we found that the overall NE region tends to be an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which may be caused by the general lack of the MIF signaling pathway in the NE region. At the same time, we observed the mutation of cell cycle ADRA1B, which led to the down-regulation of the corresponding cell cycle-related pathway in the NE region. These partial results suggest that tumors in the NE region tend to sacrifice a certain degree of growth in exchange for hijacking the nervous system to accelerate metastasis. The blocking of  these signaling pathways may be one of the ideas of postoperative targeted therapy. Date/Time28/03/202512:00-12:30LanguageEnglish",

Through in-depth interviews, we explore how mothers navigate the realm of healthcare information, drawing from both expert advice and personal experiences. While mothers typically respect doctors authority, they sometimes opt to diverge from medical recommendations. This divergence often occurs when mothers perceive a lack of individualized attention or find generic advice inadequate for their childs specific needs. By incorporating traditional Chinese remedies alongside conventional medical guidance, mothers showcase their agency in tailoring healthcare decisions to best suit their childrens well-being. This study sheds light on the nuanced interplay between professional authority and maternal decision-making in childcare practices.Speaker:Prof Xiaoli TianAssociate Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Hong KongBiosketch:Prof Xiaoli Tian is Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Hong Kong.

    description: "L.C. Chan Memorial Lecture in Medical HumanitiesMedical Humanities and Its Ramifications in China: The Expectations of Ren ()Abstract:This talk will explore the multifaceted dimensions of the medical humanities in Mainland China, introducing its history, content and features, and comparing it with health humanities, medical humanities, critical medical humanities, and narrative medicine in the West. Health humanities is a neglected term in Mainland China where it takes on very different meanings. Medical humanities is an all-encompassing term with different ramifications in Chinese academia, but the medical community expects it to play the sole role of training humane doctors. This divergence leads to the criticism by the medical community that the medical humanities has not linked theories with practice close enough. New terms such as humanistic medicine and clinical medical humanities have been proposed to solve the problem. However, in actuality, the instrumentality of the medical humanities is served by narrative medicine. The expectations of the medical humanities to train humane doctors have its social reasons. I trace this to the root in Chinese medicines expectations of Ren or benevolence in the medical practitioners.Keynote speaker:Prof GUO LipingProfessor and Dean, School of Health Humanities, Peking UniversityDate: 11 April 2025 (Fri)Time: 12:30  2:00 pmVenue: Faculty Boardroom, 1/F, Daniel and Mayce Yu Administration Wing, LKS Faculty of Medicine, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam (in-person only)Following the lecture, we will have a panel discussion on narrative in medical education and clinical practice.Discussants:- Dr TK Kong (Specialist in Geriatric Medicine; Honorary Clinical Associate Professor, Medical Ethics and Humanities Unit)- Dr Janice Tsang (Specialist in Medical Oncology; Honorary Clinical Assistant Professor, Medical Ethics and Humanities Unit)- Prof Alex Gearin (Medical anthropologist; Deputy Director and Assistant Professor, Medical Ethics and Humanities Unit) Date/Time11/04/202512:30-14:00VenueFaculty Boardroom, 1/F, Daniel and Mayce Yu Administration Wing Faculty of Medicine Building, 21 Sassoon RoadLanguageEnglish",

Stephen Chang Memorial Lecture - From Mechanisms to Treatments: Leukaemia as A Model for Development of Novel Cancer Therapeutics: Professor Eric So (Professor and Chair in Leukaemia Biology, Kings College London):The complex and ever evolving cancer genomes and epigenomes have posed serious challenges for the development of effective cancer therapeutics. The well-defined differentiation hierarchy and easy access to highly purified hematopoietic cells together with relatively simple mutational landscapes of leukaemia have provided a unique opportunity to study and understand cancer biology. Over the years, the discoveries of a number of key concepts and transformation mechanisms for leukaemia have also shed lights into other cancer subtypes. In this lecture, Professor Eric So will talk about some of the successful examples, recent development and novel therapeutic opportunities in leukaemia.

    description: "The inevitability of aging leads to a decrease in muscle mass, with a 1% decrease yearly after the age of 50. By our 80th birthday our muscle mass has decreased approximately 30% since its peak in our 20s. Sarcopenia (low muscle mass) can contribute to loss of muscular strength and function, increased risk of falls and eventual decreased independence and quality of life. Lack of physical activity is a known modifiable risk factor for sarcopenia, as such aerobic and resistance training positively improves muscle strength and function. Programme details: This 10-week exercise intervention not only aims to increase your physical activity and fitness levels but also help increase and/or maintain your muscle mass. After completing the gold-standard DXA bone density scan, you will be guided into a 10-week training intervention by CSE Exercise Specialists. Training will be conducted using various monitoring system to ensure effective workouts to help functional strength and increase muscle mass. Programme includes: Initial assessment will be arranged individually from the 31st of March - 18th of April 2025.Testing: 1) Body composition  DXA Whole Body Scan to measure muscle mass, fat mass and fat percentage 2) Blood Pressure 3) Grip Strength 4) Walking test Discussion and introduction to training, explanation of DXA result.

    description: "1. How to Improve Your Clinical Practice by Digital Technology & Artificial Intelligence? SpeakerProf Walter LamClinical Assistant Professor in Prosthodonticsat the Faculty of DentistryAbstractIn the era of digital dentistry, many labor-intensive tasks can now be assigned to, or assisted by computers, resulting in improved efficacy. Furthermore, since individual patients have unique anatomical features, risk profiles, and lifestyles, the use of digital technology is helpful in understanding individual patients and to provide personalized and precise treatment plans. This lecture will share the latest developments in digital dentistry and artificial intelligence, which can help improve the clinical workflow of your practice.2. Use of Digital Diagnostic Aids for Caries DetectionSpeakerProf Ollie YuClinical Assistant Professor in Cariologyat the Faculty of DentistryAbstractThe advance in digital diagnostic techniques has significantly facilitated the detection of dental caries in recent years. Digital diagnostic aids for caries detection can be classified according to the initial source of energy. Radiography, digital transillumination imaging, light-/laser-induced fluorescence imaging, laser-induced thermal imaging, multiphoton microscopy, optical coherence tomography, ultrasonic imaging and electric-based detections are now available as digital diagnostic aids for dental caries detection to supplement the conventional visual/tactile approaches. Digital radiography uses ionizing radiation, normally X-ray to produce images of dental structures. Digital transillumination imaging shows the optical feature of the carious lesion by transmitting near-infrared light through the teeth. Light-/laser-induced fluorescence imaging detects the changes in the fluorescence induced by laser or visible lights on the carious teeth. Laser-related imaging shows the feature change of the carious lesion induced by laser. Thermal imaging shows the thermal profile of the carious teeth. Multiphoton microscopy captures the signal of laser-excited photons from carious tooth structure. Optical coherence tomography used optical coherence light to reveal the optical scattering properties of the caries lesion. Ultrasonography detects the signal of ultrasound waves to assess the acoustic impedance of the carious teeth. Electric-based detection assesses the changes in the electric current or impedance of the teeth with caries. This lecture gives an overview of the available digital diagnostic aids for caries detection. Date/Time05/06/202518:30-20:30VenueLT1, The Prince Philip Dental Hospital / ZoomLanguageEnglish",

Such a short time state change presents serious challenges to the well-known unification scheme of AGNs and the standard model of accretion disk around black hole. In this talk I will introduce our discoveries of about 100 CLAGNs, and several of them were even found to be repeating CLAGNs. I will describe the X-ray properties of some CLAGNs and show the evidences for the changing-obscuration triggered also by the evolution of accretion disks. The multiwavelength studies on CLAGNs in the future are needed in order to fully solve the puzzles of CLAGNs.Anyone interested is welcome to attend.

    summary: "Modern drug development relies on breakthrough discoveries in basic biomedical research, through whi...",
    description: "Modern drug development relies on breakthrough discoveries in basic biomedical research, through which molecular understandings of disease pathogenesis are obtained. These basic findings provide molecular targets or rationales for developing interference molecules or drugs to be tested in clinics. Taking cancer treatment as an example, it has now entered the immunotherapy era, beginning with the groundbreaking immune checkpoint therapy. In the 1990s, researchers in academia discovered that cancer cells can hide from immune cells by using certain checkpoints, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. These checkpoints act like brakes, stopping the immune system from attacking the cancer. Industry scientists then developed drugs that block these brakes, allowing the immune system to recognise and destroy cancer cells. Since the first checkpoint inhibitor was approved in 2011, more drugs targeting checkpoints like PD-1 and PD-L1 have shown efficacy in treating various cancers. In the first part of the seminar, Dr Shao will introduce this Nobel Prize-winning work and share his perspective on how basic science can transform medicine and impact our society. Dr Shao will also share his efforts and journey in discovering novel innate immune and pyroptosis pathways and translating these discoveries into innovative drugs for treating inflammatory diseases and cancers. In 2018, Shaos team identified the ALPK1 immune receptor that recognises a bacterial metabolite called ADP-heptose to induce potent inflammation. They have developed an ALPK1 inhibitor that is entering a phase I clinical trial for inflammatory bowel disease. Their research shows that activating ALPK1 could induce effective antitumuor immunity, and an ALPK1-agonising drug is already in clinical trials for solid tumuors. Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory form of cell death. In 2015, Shaos team identified the gasdermin family of proteins, which, upon activation by various inflammatory insults, could perforate cell membranes and execute pyroptosis. Among the family, GSDMD is activated by canonical inflammasomes and endotoxin-engaged noncanonical inflammasome. GSDMD plays a prevalent role in various chronic and acute inflammatory diseases. An innovative GSDMD inhibitor has been developed, showing great promise in animal models and will soon be tested in sepsis patients. GSDME causes membrane damage or pyroptosis in chemotherapy-treated or virus-infected cells. A GSDME inhibitor has shown excellent efficacy in blocking avian flu-caused cytokine storm and is entering clinics for treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and neurodegeneration diseases like ALS. Furthermore, Shaos team has found that pyroptosis of less than 15% tumour cells is sufficient to render tumour clearance by stimulating antitumour immunity, which is being exploited for developing the next-generation cancer immunotherapy.

A poster child in this respect is the Gale-Shapley work (1962) on stable matching. This talk concerns cardinal-utility matching markets, for which the most prominent mechanism was due to Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979); this pricing-based mechanism has all the game-theoretic properties one could ask for. However, recent work has established it to be computationally intractable in theory and practice.This talk will summarize several papers which:a. Established intractability.b. Proposed a replacement mechanism based on Nash bargaining.c. Established its game-theoretic and computational properties and gave evidence that there may not be a better alternative.

This model accommodates a potentially infinite number of species (taxa) and unknown parameters, allowing us to learn as more data is gathered within a Bayesian machine learning framework. We focus on the challenging context of microbiome analysis and related ecological species sampling models to address existing gaps in modelling capabilities. Our model offers a generative process for these phenomena, providing flexible sparse multivariate count models that account for overdispersion while also modelling latent OTU counts. We present tractable methods for sampling and posterior analysis in this complex setting, introducing novel parameters that reflect species abundance as well as alpha and beta diversity. We also provide indications for novel approaches to the formidable problem of unseen entities in future samples.

    description: "Comparative research is useful for identifying meaningful variations across groups, contexts and settings, and is especially important for complicating the monolithic assumptions drawn about gender inequality and the lives of South Asian women. I utilize two case studies from my longstanding collaborative work on gender, crime and justice to illustrate the import of such work: a comparative assessment of patterns of intimate partner violence across South Asia, and a study of Indian and Sri Lankan womens narratives of their pathways to incarceration and gendered patterns of incarceration. These cases demonstrate the multi-layered ways in which comparative work can provide locally grounded insights for theory and intervention, while also bringing us closer to identifying shared causes, patterns and consequences of crime, victimization and (in)justice. About the speaker:Jody Miller (she/her) is Distinguished Professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University and a Fellow of the American Society of Criminology. She studies how gender inequalities shape risks for crime and victimization, with concentrations in the United States and South Asia.

The lecture will highlight how LTC investment can enhance allocative efficiency, leading to a more effective and equitable distribution of healthcare resources.Dr. Yang will also discuss how strategic LTC investment can significantly reduce hospital delays, improving overall healthcare system efficiency by optimising resource utilisation.  She will critically examine the role of LTC insurance in easing the burden on informal carers.  By reducing caregiving responsibilities, LTC insurance can support greater labour market participation, particularly among younger household members, freeing up their time and resources.Emphasising the broader implications of her findings, Dr. Yang will conclude by urging policymakers to rethink their LTC investment strategies, given its potential to deliver substantial economic and societal benefits.About the Speaker:Dr. Wei Yang is an Associate Professor in Health Economics and Policy and Director of the Institute of Gerontology at Kings College London.  Her research focuses on the impact of health and ageing policies on care access inequities and health financing efficiency, using longitudinal survey data.

    description: "Topic: Regional Development Traps and Regional Innovation Policy. The Case of European RegionsSchedule:Date:  31 March 2025 (Monday)Time: 15:00  16:00 (HKT)Venue: LE 3, LG1/ F, Library Extension BuildingAbstract: Recently, the development trap concept has been introduced to identify regions that get caught in persistent patterns of low economic growth and stagnation (Iammarino et al. 2020). Evolutionary scholars have indicated that self-reinforcing dynamics can limit the capacity of regions to innovate and develop new growth paths (Arthur 1989, 1994). However, an evolutionary approach to regional development traps is still underdeveloped. We build on but also go beyond recent work by Pinheiro et al. (2022), among others, that argue that regions might become trapped in low-complexity activities, because their opportunities to develop high-complex activities are very limited, since relevant capabilities are missing.A novel concept of regional traps is proposed that is embedded in evolutionary thinking, and that accounts for the persistent weak ability of many regions to develop new activities and upgrade their economies into more complex activities. We build on the relatedness/complexity framework (Balland et al. 2019) to measure and identify regional traps and to develop a new typology of regional traps. We aim to shed light on the possible links between regional development traps (low growth/stagnation traps) as defined by Iammarino et al. (2020) and our new typology of regional traps, following an evolutionary approach (Balland et al. 2019). We discuss the policy implications, like what to do about regional traps, how to successfully escape them, and how to avoid them in the future. This is crucial for regional innovation policy in places that find themselves trapped or run the risk of falling into a trap.Speaker:Prof. Ron BoschmaProfessor in Regional Economics, Department of Human Geography and Planning, Utrecht University, NetherlandsProfessor in Innovation Studies, UiS Business School, Stavanger University, NorwayRon Boschma is full professor in Regional Economics at Utrecht University, and Professor in Innovation Studies at UiS Business School of Stavanger University.

    description: "Consent is fundamentally important to medical practice since it generally determines whether treatment is lawful. In the ten years following the landmark decision in Montgomery v Lanarkshire, which established a pro-patient standard for information disclosure, several significant legal changes have occurred. This seminar will explore the legal issues arising from consent to medical treatment, including important decisions from across common law and legislative interventions such as the Advance Decision on Life-Sustaining Treatment Ordinance. The practical application and implications of these developments for medical practice in Hong Kong will also be examined.
